    "* [**Cross-validation**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) - Splits your dataset into multiple parts and train and tests your model on each part and evaluates performance as an average. \n",
    "* [**Precision**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of samples. Higher precision leads to less false positives.\n",
    "* [**Recall**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of true positives and false positives. Higher recall leads to less false negatives.\n",
    "* [**F1 score**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) - Combines precision and recall into one metric. 1 is best, 0 is worst.\n",
    "* [**Classification report**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) - Sklearn has a built-in function called `classification_report()` which returns some of the main classification metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score.\n",
    "* [**ROC Curve**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_score.html) - [Receiver Operating Characterisitc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) is a plot of true positive rate versus false positive rate.\n",
